# UC Berkeley High School Engineering Program (HSEP)

I was selected for the **UC Berkeley High School Engineering Program (HSEP)**, where I explored foundational concepts in engineering and built interactive projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

This project explores animation using the HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It was part of a hands-on learning module where we experimented with movement, interaction, and visuals through code.
